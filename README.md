# pyBucardo

Hi all, the aim of this program is to add a remote database for bucardo realtime replication between master and slave. This is for a purpose education so don't hesitate to give a feedback
Bucardo is a very good tools to have an akamaster postgresql database in production not under scope of modelization or conception.Not that bucardo doesn't add the table you add after synchro, you must to add it manually this is why I developped this program. 
# Run add_sync.sh to add your first database. 

# Use, improve and then share.
Don't hesitate to ask.
